# ACM.BL
 C# class library repo
 
 This is my first attempt at creating a class library and Unit Tests in C#
 
 The class library mimics a Custimer Order system for a buisness.
 The main aims of this exercice was to learn about class constructors, properties and fields, Encapsulation, Access Modifiers,
 Collaboration, Composition and Inheritance
 
 Classes and Methods Featured.: 
  - Address class
    -Validate()
    
  - AddressRepsitory class
    - Retrieve()    
    - RetrieveByCustoemrId()
    - Save()
    
  - Customer class
     - Validate()
     
  - CustomerRepositry class
     - Retrieve()
     - RetrieveAll()    
     
  - EntityBase class
  (a user defined ase class)
  
  - Orders class
    - Validate()    
    
  - OrderItem class
    - RetrieveOrders()
    - Save()
    
  - OrderRepository class
    - Save()
    
  - Product class
    - Validate()
    
  - ProductRepository class
    - Save()
    - Retreive()
  
 LIMITATIONS: 
 - the save() and retrieve() methods are not functional. They are represtations of save and read functions as this is outside the scope of my learning so far.
     - will be revisted in the future when I learn to implement file-handling.
